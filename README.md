This project is meant to provide an online implementation of the [Tac board-game](https://spieltac.de/), in particular popular in Germany.
The game logic is written in Prolog.
A work-in-progress game server is written in Rust.
For testing, there is the functionality to draw the game state, implemented in `draw_tac.py`.
